# Integrity & Authorship Note

All ENA PH5–PH6 runtime logs and CDI reports are **native components of the ENA architecture**, not external artifacts.

**What they are:**
- JSON-schemas use open standards (`SHA-256` for integrity, `Ed25519` for optional signing).
- The PH5/PH6 pipeline implements **ENA’s internal logic** — *Compliance & Persist* and *Meta-Reflection*.
- The **CDI report** (Cognitive Dissonance Index) quantifies coherence between `SCI`, `MeaningGap`, and `Trust EMA` within the ENA subjectivity model.

**What they are not:**
- Not imported from other frameworks (Kai, Axis, Continuum, or any LLM-based systems).
- Not copied code — only structural compatibility with public JSON standards.
